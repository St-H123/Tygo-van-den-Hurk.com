# Tygo-van-den-Hurk.com
This reposositry holds the source code for [my website](https://tygo-van-den-hurk.com/).
It is in this repository because this way, I can always keep it up to date, and I was 
hoping there would be a way for me to just let the server pull the contents of the
repository with a single command. This however, I have not been able to do yet.

This repository is archived as I decided to move to other technologies, and wanted to
start fresh.
