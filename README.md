In this repository I stored the config files for apache, the content for apache to serve, and the docker config file. This way I could start the server in just three commands in case of a wipe, crash, or lose of any kind:
```BASH
$ git clone https://github.com/St-H123/tygo-van-den-hurk.com.git
$ cd tygo-van-den-hurk.com/
$ docker compose up --detach
```

I would be up in as little as 30 minutes. This project also allowed me to both learn [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in one project. Overal it's been a success!
